"""MediCare Patient Records Manager — entry point.

Business problem: reception exports a messy patients CSV every week.
The clinic needs it validated, stored cleanly, and summarised.

Run from the project folder (with the venv active):
    python main.py

This file is COMPLETE — no TODOs here. Once your clinic package works,
this program works. Read it top to bottom before you start coding:
it shows you exactly how your functions and class will be used.
